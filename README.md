# date_trans_with_attention
a pytorch implementation of machine translation model that translates human readable dates (eg: "25th of June, 2009", "Thursday, June 25, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25")
LSTM and attention mechanism are used

usage:
    python3 train.py, if gpu is not available, python train.py no_gpu
